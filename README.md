## Computer Science

### DSA:
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and queues
- Hash Maps / Sets
- Binary Trees, BST, Heaps

<b>Resources: </b>
1. [Algorithm Design Manual](https://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf)
2. [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/ )

### Main Algorithms
- Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort, Counting Sort)
- Binary Search
- Greedy
- DP (dynamic programming)
- Divide & Conquer
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, etc)
- Two Pointers
- Bit Manipulation

### How to hack Leetcode?
1. Easy level (decide on each topic)
2. Middle level (decide on main topics)
3. Hard (it's useful but rare)

The main thing:
1. Regularity (at least 1-2 problens per day)
2. Error analysis (why didn't it work?)
3. Repeat (re-solve solved tasks)

In 6-12 months, you'll be snapping Medium/Hard like peanuts!
